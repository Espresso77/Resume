\section{INTERESTS}          
    I enjoy having a variety of work. Most of my time recently has been spent on the design and
    development of Magento modules, and leading a team of developers and QA's from around the world. \\
    Golang, ReactJS, PostGresQL, and AngularJS are some of the newer technologies that I'm currently
    reading up on and am interested in working with in the future.
