# Resume
Personal resume written in LaTeX

Note: This is my first document written in LaTeX. The goal is just to reduce the time spent maintaining a resume by using programmer friendly tools and techniques.

#### Run the following to setup local editing in Ubuntu/Linux Mint
```
sudo apt-get install texlive
sudo apt-get install texmaker
```

Then rename `contact.tex.example` to `contact.tex` to include personal contact information.
