\section{ABSTRACT}          
    I enjoy having a variety of work. Most of my time recently has been spent on DevOps work	building environments for development, deployment, and automation of common tasks with docker and bash. Previously, I have worked with international teams on the design and development of Magento modules for B2B sites.
